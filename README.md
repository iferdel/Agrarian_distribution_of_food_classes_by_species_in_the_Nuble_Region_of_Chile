# Agrarian distribution of food classes by species in the Ñuble region of Chile

This notebook **simulates** a real case of extracting, cleaning and displaying the agrarian data of food classes in the Ñuble region of Chile. Therefore, all the data that includes this repository is artificially created by the code presented in *xlsx_generator_random.ipynb*.

**Python 3.7** is the version that applies for the main notebook (*Agrarian_distribution_of_food_classes_by_specie.ipynb*) due to the modules needed.

The main Jupyter Notebook of this repository works as a **Guide or Procedure** and by pressing the corresponding cells you can check what was written to accomplish what you are seeing. `So are the modules extraction, transform, load and spatial, which are intended to recreate a way to approach the solution by adding modularity to the code presented in the main notebook.`
